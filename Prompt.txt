Create a clean, modern About Us page for the ClimateHub website. The design should be youth-friendly but professional, using a minimal and engaging style.

The page should include:

Header

Title: “About Us”

Subtitle: Meet the team behind ClimateHub — youth building tools for a sustainable future.

Team Section

Three team members, displayed in a grid of profile cards (with space for photos). Each card should include the person’s name, role/title, and a short description of their contributions.

Styling Notes

Use a modern grid layout with clean cards

Keep the color scheme consistent with ClimateHub’s branding (green, white, and earthy tones)
