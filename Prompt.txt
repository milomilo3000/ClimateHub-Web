You are redesigning the **Summary Results Page** of the ClimateHub carbon footprint calculator. 
The goal is to make the layout more visual and engaging while maintaining data clarity and scientific credibility.

### CONTEXT
- The top section (summary + charts) is already implemented.
- You need to redesign the **Impact Measures** and **Recommendations** sections to be visually rich, interactive, and emotionally engaging.
- Keep a minimalist aesthetic consistent with ClimateHub’s brand (white, green, gray, with accent icons and rounded cards).

---

### 🎨 DESIGN GOAL
Transform the lower half of the results page into two horizontal sections:
1. **Impact Measures (Visual Data Cards)**
2. **Recommendations (Interactive Swipe Cards)**

---

### 🧩 SECTION 1 — IMPACT MEASURES

**Layout:**
- Title: “Your Impact in Context 🌍”
- 2–3 horizontal visual cards, each spanning full width (responsive carousel on mobile).
- Each card displays one key “relatability metric” — e.g. Trees Absorbed, Sea Level Rise, Plastic Bottles Equivalent.
- Each card has:
  - A relevant background image or gradient overlay (e.g. trees, ocean, cityscape).
  - A bold number (e.g. “9,210 Trees”) in center.
  - A short contextual line below (“If all 40,000 NSFs emitted like you, that’s 9 million trees’ worth of CO₂.”)
  - A subtle icon in the corner (🌳, 🌊, 🏙️).
- Add a **scroll or dot navigation** if multiple cards exist.
- Background should dim slightly on hover for interactivity.

**Design Specs:**
- Card height: 220–250px
- Border-radius: 20px
- Background: use subtle semi-transparent overlay (e.g. `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.1)`)
- Font color: white or dark depending on background
- Font weight: numbers in 700–800, context text in 500
- Add subtle animation: fade-in / slide from left on load

**Code behavior:**
- Create `<ImpactMeasures />` component.
- Accepts props: `userCO2`, `groupFactor=40000`
- Dynamically computes:
  - `treeEquivalent = userCO2 / 22`
  - `groupTreeEquivalent = treeEquivalent * 40000`
  - `seaLevelEquivalent = userCO2 * seaRiseFactor`
  - `scaledSeaLevel = seaLevelEquivalent * 40000`
- Render cards with computed numbers.
- Example visuals:
  - 🌳 “Tree Equivalence” → photo of forest background.
  - 🌊 “Sea-Level Rise Impact” → ocean horizon background.
  - 🔋 “Energy Equivalent” → Singapore skyline at night.

### 🌿 SECTION 2 — RECOMMENDATIONS (INTERACTIVE)

**Layout:**
- Title: “What You Can Do Next 💡”
- Display a stack of **Recommendation Cards** with tick ✅ and cross ❌ buttons on left/right edges of the card.
- Each card contains:
  - A short title (“Reduce Electronics Usage”)
  - A one-line actionable tip (“Unplug devices when not in use.”)
  - A subtle icon (💻, 🍔, 🚎, 🏠, 🛍️)
- When the user clicks ✅, the card slides right and fades (marked “done”).
- When ❌, it slides left and disappears.
- After each swipe, show the next recommendation in stack (like Tinder-style cards).

**Design Specs:**
- Card width: 80% of container (centered)
- Height: 120–140px
- Border-radius: 16px
- Background: white with soft shadow (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`)
- Animation: spring-like slide/fade using Framer Motion
- Button icons on left/right (✅ ❌) slightly overlap the card edge (like circular floating buttons)
- Progress indicator (3 dots) below card stack

**Code Behavior:**
- Create `<RecommendationCarousel />` component
- Props: `recommendations = []`
- Each recommendation object: `{ title, description, icon }`
- Use Framer Motion or React Spring for transitions
- On swipe or button press, move to next card
- Optional: store completed cards in localStorage (“actions taken”)

---

### 📱 RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- On desktop: show impact cards horizontally, rec cards centered
- On mobile: stack impact cards vertically with swipe scroll; make rec cards full width

---

### ✨ ADDITIONAL TOUCHES
- Add subtle hover animations or parallax motion for impact visuals
- Add info tooltip icons (“i”) to show data sources (“1 mature tree absorbs ~22kg CO₂/year”)
- Add share button: “Share my footprint” (generate shareable image of summary)
- Add optional badge if user’s footprint is below average (“🌿 Great job! You’re greener than 70% of users.”)
