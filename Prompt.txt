These are the fixes that need to be made regarding the carbon footprint calculator section:

- There is still no moving animation of the birds on the screen or the leaves, or other animated objects, etc. I need it to
They should be moving vertically or horizontally depending, as a repetitive animation on the screen like a replaying video.



- Make the slider colour darker green so that it can be seen. right now it is blending in completely with the form box colour,
so the slider cant even be seen (only a small circle can be seen). you had only made the colour of the cirlce dark green, not the line itself.
