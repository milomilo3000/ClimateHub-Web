You are redefining the Carbon Footprint Calculator questions. Update the questions exactly as listed below, and for each, implement calculation logic using the emission factors provided. Use median values for ranges. Always multiply the chosen option’s activity data by the corresponding emission factor. If an option is “Never” or “0”, return 0 emissions for that question.

Electronics Usage
Q1: Social Media
Options: 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6+ hours/day


EF: 0.123 kgCO2/hour


Logic: Use median (1, 3, 5, 7 hours/day × 7 days). Multiply by EF.


Q2: Gaming
Options: 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6+ hours/day


EF: 0.0044 kgCO2/hour


Logic: Median (1, 3, 5, 7 × 7 days) × EF.


Q3: Streaming (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify)
Options: 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6+ hours/day


EF: 0.055 kgCO2/hour


Logic: Median × days × EF.


Q4: Work/OSN/Laptop
Options: 0–2, 2–4, 4–6, 6+ hours/day


EF: 0.025 kgCO2/hour


Logic: Median × days × EF.


Q5: Phone charging
Options: 1, 2, 3, 4+ times/day


EF: 0.3 kgCO2/full charge


Logic: Multiply by chosen frequency × 7 days.



Diet & Food Habits
Q1: Beef/Pork consumption
Options: 0, 1–3, 3–7, 7+ times/week


EF: Beef = 24.4, Pork = 12.0


Logic: For simplicity, use average EF = 18.2 kgCO2/meal. Multiply by median (0, 2, 5, 7).


Q2: Other Meats (Chicken/Fish/Duck)
EF average: (3.5 + 6.3 + 4.2)/3 = 4.67 kgCO2/meal


Options: 0, 1–3, 3–7, 7+ times/week


Logic: Median × EF.


Q3: Bubble tea
EF: 0.4 kgCO2/cup


Logic: Multiply by median (0, 2, 5, 7).


Q4: Takeaway/Order-in (Canteen, Lim Kopi, etc.)
EF: 0.28 kgCO2/meal


Options: 0, 1–3, 3–7, 7+


Logic: Median × EF.


Q5: Packaged snacks/drinks (Cheers, 7-11, etc.)
EF: 0.5 kgCO2/item


Logic: Median × EF.


Q6: Food Waste
Options: Never, Rarely, Often, Always


EF: 0.134 kgCO2/meal wasted


Logic: Scale factor:


Never = 0


Rarely = 0.25 × 21 meals


Often = 0.5 × 21 meals


Always = 1 × 21 meals
 Multiply by EF.



Transport
Q1: Public Transport Trips (MRT/LRT/Buses)
EF: Use weighted average = 0.05 kgCO₂/km.


Logic: Multiply home-to-camp distance (Q4 median value) × number of trips selected (median of option range). Multiply by EF.


Q2: Car/Taxi Trips
EF: 0.192 kgCO₂/km.


Logic: Multiply home-to-camp distance × trips × EF.


Q3: Motorbike/E-Scooter Trips
EF: 0.12 kgCO₂/km.


Logic: Multiply home-to-camp distance × trips × EF.


Q4: Distance from Home to Camp
Options: 0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 15+ km


Medians: 3, 8, 13, 18 km.


Logic: This value is reused by Q1–Q3 for trip calculations.

Home & Utilities
Q1: Home type multiplier
HDB = 1.0 baseline


Condo = 1.4


Landed = 2.2


Q2: Bedrooms (proxy for size)
Add as multiplier: 1 → 0.7, 2 → 1.0, 3 → 1.2, 4+ → 1.4.


Q3: Cooling type
If “Fan only”: Skip aircon questions. This means the aircon questions should not be visible to the user.


If “Aircon” or “Both”: Continue, show the aircon questions. 


Q4: Aircon usage (hours/day)
EF: Aircon = 0.33 kgCO2/hour, Fan = 0.06 kgCO2/hour.


Logic: Median × EF × 7.


Q5: Aircon temperature adjustment
Multipliers: <20 = 1.15, 20–23 = 1.0, 24–26 = 0.9, 26+ = 0.8.


Apply multiplier to Q4 Aircon result.


Q6: Showers/day
EF: 0.8 kgCO2/shower


Options: 1, 2, 3+. Multiply by 7.


Q7: Appliances turned off?
Options multipliers: Never = 1.3, Rarely = 1.15, Often = 1.07, Always = 1.0.


Apply multiplier to total household electricity usage.



Shopping
Q1: In-person shopping trips
EF: 0.2 kgCO2/trip


Logic: Median × EF.


Q2: Reusable Bag Usage as a Section Multiplier
Baseline: Packaging emissions from shopping (Q1).


Logic: User’s bag choice scales the Q1 question.


Never = ×1.0 (full impact)


Rarely = ×0.75 (slight reduction)


Often = ×0.25 (significant reduction)


Always = ×0.05 (near zero from bags)



Q3: Online shopping frequency
EF: 2.0 kgCO2/order (delivery impact)


Logic: Median × EF.



Implementation Notes
Median Values for Ranges
 Always use the middle number (e.g., 2–4 → 3).


Multipliers


Apply multipliers in order: base × housing × behavior.


Use fan/aircon skip logic.
